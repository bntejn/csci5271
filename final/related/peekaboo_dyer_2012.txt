Comments: This paper evaluates different packet level countermeasures against 3 different classifiers. It proposes a VNG++ classifier of its own which uses variable n-grams, total time and bandwidth in each direction of the connection with naive Bayes. It then proposes a new defense mechanism called BuFlo which sends out fixed-sized packets at fixed time intervals for a predetermined amount of time and evaluate this defense mechanism.
