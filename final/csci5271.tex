\begin{abstract}
We present a novel defense mechanism to protect against website fingerprinting attacks. 
Link prefetching has been used by website developers to improve user browsing experience by anticipating what web content the user is likely to browse to next and caching it in the browser in advance. 
Link prefetching causes extra upstream and downstream packets to be introduced in the network traffic for a webpage thereby altering its fingerprint. 
We evaluate the effect of link prefetching on classifier accuracy by alternating the prefetching browser setting between training and test sets. Our results strongly suggest that link prefetching can be used to alter webpage network fingerprints regardless of the feature sets being used by the classifiers. 
We then evaluate the effect of varying the number of prefetching requests and size of prefetched responses but find the Tor browser dishonors large number of prefetch requests.
