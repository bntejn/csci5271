\subsection{Link Pre-fetching}
Today's web browsers, including Tor, makes use of a specific syntax called \emph{pre-fetching}, which was proposed as a draft standard by Mozilla. Using pre-fetching, browser can predicts documents likely to be visited by the user in the near future. Therefore, based on the hint provided by pre-fetching a browser is able to fetch those documents a head of time. In fact, it is the web page that provides a set of pre-fetching hints for the browser. Then, loading the page and passing an idle time, the browser starts to pre-fetch and cache specified documents. Needless to say, this mechanism improves efficiency. Particularly, it is most effective if the content provider may be reasonably certain which links users are going to visit next \cite{wikiPreF}.
