\emph{The content of this section will be changed later.} Penchenko et al. \cite{panchenko11} were among the first to report website fingerprinting attacks with reasonable accuracy on Tor. This paper provides a sufficient understanding of the feature set and classification framework required for this attack. Some of the team members are familiar with data mining techniques and software packages required for their use. All team members have access to the compute servers provided by the Computer Science and Engineering department and will request access to the other high performance computing resources if required.
