\section{Who}
%All members of the proposed group, and a group or project name.
The group member details are as follows in name, email format:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Vaibhav Sharma, vaibhav@umn.edu
\item Se Eun Oh, seoh@umn.edu
\item Taejoon Byun, taejoon@umn.edu
\item Elaheh Ghassabani, ghass013@umn.edu

\end{enumerate}

We propose our project name to be: ``An Evaluation of Website
Fingerprinting Attacks in Anonymization Networks''.


\section{What}
%The paper(s) your project will be based on (listing one or two related choices for discussion would be acceptable).
We plan to explore the area of website fingerprinting in anonymization
networks starting with the paper ``Website Fingerprinting in Onion Routing
Based Anonymization Networks''\cite{panchenko2011}. Another interesting
paper presenting a defense against website fingerprinting is
``StegoTorus: a camouflage proxy for the Tor anonymity
system''\cite{weinberg2012}. 

\section{Why}
%Why is this a good paper for your group to base a project around? What skills and resources can you access that will allow you to succesfully complete the project?
Penchenko et al.\cite{panchenko2011} were among the first to report
website fingerprinting attacks with reasonable accuracy on Tor. This
paper provides a sufficient understanding of the feature set and
classification framework required for this attack. \\
Some of the team members are familiar with data mining techniques and
software packages required for their use. All team members have access
to the compute servers provided by the Computer Science and Engineering
department and will request access to the other high performance
computing resources if required.

\section{How}
%How do you intend to reproduce the paper's results? What extensions or attacks do you have in mind, and how will you evaluate them?
Our first goal for this project is to understand website fingerprinting
attacks on anonymization networks recently proposed in literature as
well as understand defenses proposed against them. Our next goal will be
to either augment a recently proposed attack by augmenting the feature
set/classification framework or to propose a defense against a recently
proposed attack. In either case, we plan to evaluate our changes against
a data set that closely resembles network traffic seen in a real-world
anonymization network. 

\section{When}
%A list of at least three half-hour time slots during a typical week in
%which your group members are all available for a progress meeting with
%the instructor.
Preferred time slots:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Monday 1:00-1:30 PM(4 pts)
\item Wednesday 1:30-2:00PM(2 pts)
\item Friday 4:00-4:30 PM(4 pts)
