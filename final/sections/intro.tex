Anonymizing networks are privacy technologies that provide a mancinism to anonymize internet communications so as to protect users from network eavesdroppers. Although such systems are able to hide the communication (including both routing information and content), an attacker is still able to obtain different information by analyzing the network traffic. Network analysis can provides very rich information about message length, timing, and frequency by which an attacker can easily identify the communicating parties, and therefore bypass bypass an anonymizing system. This problem is known as Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack, where the adversary attempts to recognize the encrypted traffic patterns of specific web pages without using any other information \cite{juarez14, murdoch2005low}.

% we should say, there is lots of work trying to prevent WF attack. And, in this project, we studied most of the state of the art works, and tries to provide a novel defend mechanism [or something similar]

% we want to add a summary about we have done
