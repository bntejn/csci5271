\section{Taejoon's Contribution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
{\bf Summary}:
Taejoon had been actively engaged in this project throughout the whole semester.
He participated in every meeting with Professor McCamant and every big and small team meetings.
His major contribution on this project lies in writing about the effect of prefetching, data collection, and performing experiment together with Viabhav (he is the major contributor).
\item
{\bf Idea}: Taejoon has first suggested the direction of our research to study defense mechanism against website fingerprinting attacks by changing the contents on the server side, which was concretized through Vaibhav's suggestion to use link prefetching as a way of doing it.
\item
{\bf Experiment}
\begin{itemize}
\item
He designed and performed the experiments together with Vaibhav and provided frequent feedback about the intermediary results.
\item
Taejoon did everything related to data collection, from analysis of prefetching websites to packet capturing for all the dataset.
This involved setting up virtual machines to gather dataset, writing several Python scripts to crawl 6000 websites to find which website implements prefetching, and running a crawler multiple times.
\item
He also constructed the expererimental setting to see how different prefetching parameters affect the acuracy of fingerprinting, by setting up a copy of a famous website and implementing a script to control the size and number of resources to pre-fetch.
\end{itemize}
\item
{\bf Writing}: Taejoon organized the structure of the paper and wrote the fourth section.
\item
{\bf Presentation}: Taejoon wrote 70\% of the final presentation slides, and delivered 50\% of the work to the audience in class.
\item
{\bf Logistics}: Taejoon set up and managed tools and services to facilitate communication and an efficient collaboration among the team members -- he set up a Slack page {\tt csci5271.slack.com} which was actively used throughout the semester as a primary means of discussion and file sharing, and also managed the Git repository.
\item
{\bf Hours Spent}: Taejoon spent an average of 7 hours for the last 6 days, 20 hours for the presentation, an average of 7 hours on the Thanks Giving holiday (for 3 days), and an average of 4 hours a week for the rest of the weeks throughout this semester.
$t_{\mathit{last\_week}} = 7 \times 6 = 42$,
$t_{\mathit{presentation\_week}} = 20$,
$t_{\mathit{holiday}} = 7 \times 3 = 21$,
$t_{\mathit{weekly}} = 10 \times 4 = 40$,
$T = 42 + 20 + 21 + 40 = 123 (hours)$.
\end{enumerate}
